Gun Violence in correaltion to Racial and Political Demographics

In this project This project examines demographics of state voters in correlation to gun violence. Although realistically it is visceral how these policies will correlate, our team thought it would nonetheless be a good idea to examine the data and possibilites behind it. 

The scope of this project given limited time only utilizes racial demographics and voting demographics per state. In the future, steps will be taken to get a closer look at more predictor variavbles that include lobbying, political figures' investment, etc. 

For this benefits the public sphere, if desired, feel free to take this code for your own experiments.
